Step-by-step: Create branches using Git

Nice — I’ll give a clear, simple, step-by-step process you can follow. Each step has the exact commands. Use whichever shell/terminal you prefer (Terminal, PowerShell, Git Bash).

1. Make sure your local repo is up to date

Open terminal in your repo folder.

Fetch remote updates:

git fetch origin


Switch to main (or the branch you want to branch from):

git switch main
# or: git checkout main


Pull the latest changes:

git pull origin main

2. Create a new branch and switch to it

Create and switch in one command (recommended):

git switch -c feature/my-feature


Alternative older command:

git checkout -b feature/my-feature


feature/my-feature is the branch name. Use a descriptive name like feature/login-form or fix/navbar-bug.

3. Work on your changes

Edit files as needed.

Stage your changes:

git add .
# or add specific files: git add src/app.js


Commit with a message:

git commit -m "feat: add login form layout"

4. Push the branch to GitHub and set upstream

Push and set the branch to track the remote:

git push -u origin feature/my-feature


After this, future pushes can use:

git push
